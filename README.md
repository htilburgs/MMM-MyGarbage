### Example config
## Creating and using your Garbage Schedule
You can use this module by creating your own Garbage Schedule file with the name `garbage_schedule.csv` 
An example file `garbage_schedule.csv` is added.

Create a CSV based on the following template:

```
WeekStarting,green,gray,cornflowerblue
03/07/18,1,0,1
03/14/18,1,1,1
03/21/18,1,0,1
03/28/18,1,1,1
```

Add lines for each garbage pickup date as needed.
The date format needs to be specified as `MM/DD/YY` (e.g.: 05/28/18 for 28-May-2018)

Possible Values for colors:
* Legacy Values:
  * GreenBin (defaults to #00A651)
  * GarbageBin (defaults to #787878)
  * PaperBin (defaults to #0059ff)
* Any CSS color string (red, chocolate, cornflowerblue, etc..)
* Any HEX-Color (#FF0000, #8c8c8c, etc)
* Any rgb, rgba or hsl value **if in double quotes** ("rgb(128,65,98)", "rgba(134,56,32,0.5)", "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)", etc.)

The following is VERY important:
* The CSV file must be delimited using commas
* The date format needs to be specified as `MM/DD/YY` (e.g.: 05/28/18 for 28-May-2018)
* The remaining fields of each line specify whether the particular waste product is scheduled to be picked up on the given date. A value of `0` means no pick up. A value of ANYTHING ELSE means the product will be picked up.  Using the first pick up date entry in the template above, `1,0,1` means that `green` and `cornflowerblue` will be picked up on that date, while `gray` will not be picked up.

Save the file as `garbage_schedule.csv` in the `MMM-MyGarbage` directory and restart Magic Mirror²
